<p>The Lion and the Rabbit

    Once there was a <b>Lion</b> in the jungle who used to<del> kill 2-3 animals</del> daily for his meal. All animals went to him to tell, that daily one of them will come to him for his meal.<br>
    So,<ins> the Lion agree</ins> and this started going for many days. One day, it was Rabbit’s turn. When he was on his way he saw a well.<br>
    Now <mark>he plans to kill the lion and save himself</mark>. He went to the lion and told him that, <strong>there is another lion who claims to be more powerful</strong> than him.<br>
    
    Then the lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion. The rabbit takes him to the well and said he lives here. When the lion looked in the well he saw his own reflection and jumped in the well and dies.<br>
